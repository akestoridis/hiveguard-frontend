# hiveguard-frontend

Frontend for HiveGuard


## Instructions

Currently, you can install the HiveGuard frontend application as follows:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/akestoridis/hiveguard-frontend.git
$ cd hiveguard-frontend/
$ npm install
```

Then, you can build the HiveGuard frontend application by executing the following command:
```console
$ npm run build
```

During development, you can launch a web server that serves the HiveGuard frontend application by executing the following command:
```console
$ npm run start:dev
```


## Screenshots

The following screenshots show how different HiveGuard pages display different types of fetched data.
More specifically, the first screenshot demonstrates how the HiveGuard frontend application presents fetched topology data, while the remaining three screenshots showcase patterns that were observed shortly after an energy depletion attack started.
